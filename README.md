# Predicting-Credit-Card-Approvals
This project involves analyzing a credit card application dataset to develop a machine learning model for predicting credit card approvals. The dataset includes features such as age, income, education level, and ethnicity, among others. The project will involve preprocessing the dataset to address any issues, such as missing values or imbalanced classes, before applying machine learning algorithms to train and test the model. The goal of the project is to develop a model that accurately predicts credit card approvals and can be used to improve the credit application process.
